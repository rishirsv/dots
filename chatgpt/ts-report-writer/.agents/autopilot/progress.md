# Progress Log

- Initialized batch PRD for remaining reports.
- Generated 54 remaining-report stories (all source reports except completed `project-ascend-report` and `project-autobahn-report`).
- Added duplicate-stem handling policy in queue (prefer `.pptx` over `.pdf` for duplicate stems).

- Excluded benchmarking packs from queue (removed 4 stories).
- Excluded completed reports from queue (removed 0 stories).\n- Excluded case-study reports from queue (removed 1 stories).\n## [2026-02-13 14:31:32 EST] - 1.0: Extract and fully clean Example report_Private Equity lender_Project Garrison.pptx

Run: 20260213-142610-36275 (iteration 1)

- Guardrails reviewed: yes
- Commit: e90a347 1.0: extract and clean example-report-private-equity-lender-project-garrison
- Verification: `./.venv/bin/python scripts/qa_provenance.py --markdown extracted/example-report-private-equity-lender-project-garrison.md --source-manifest extracted/verification/example-report-private-equity-lender-project-garrison/source-text/manifest.json --out-dir extracted/verification/example-report-private-equity-lender-project-garrison/qa && ./.venv/bin/python scripts/qa_gates.py --report-id example-report-private-equity-lender-project-garrison` -> PASS

  - extracted/manifests/tracker.json
  - extracted/manifests/tracker.md
  - extracted/verification/example-report-private-equity-lender-project-garrison/*
- What was implemented:
  - Ran strict extraction for only `reports/Example report_Private Equity lender_Project Garrison.pptx` and generated report/verification artifacts.
  - Generated source-text artifacts with `scripts/extract_source_text.py` in strict mode.
  - Completed full canonical cleanup output, populated metadata + source-evidence fields, and filled source-to-extraction coverage map.
  - Completed review notes checklist and marked report review `pass` after QA.
  - Updated story state in PRD to `passes=true` and added reusable cleanup-learning guardrail.
- **Learnings:**
  - PPTX auto-mapping can leak legal/navigation content into canonical sections if cleanup is not done report-wide.
  - Enforcing a full-report cleanup pass before provenance/gates prevents executive-summary boilerplate regressions.

## [2026-02-13 14:33:24 EST] - 2.0: Extract and fully clean FDD and Value Creation example 1 (Consumer & Retail).pptx (BLOCKED)

Run: 20260213-142610-36275 (iteration 2)

- Blocked reason: Source report `reports/FDD and Value Creation example 1 (Consumer & Retail).pptx` is `CDFV2 Encrypted`, and strict source-text extraction via `scripts/extract_source_text.py` fails with `File is not a zip file`.
- Attempted: Ran single-report pipeline in strict/fail-closed mode using isolated reports dir; then ran `./.venv/bin/python scripts/extract_source_text.py --source "reports/FDD and Value Creation example 1 (Consumer & Retail).pptx" --out-dir extracted/verification/fdd-and-value-creation-example-1-consumer-retail/source-text --verbatim-mode strict`, which failed due to encryption.
- Recommendation: Provide a decryptable `.pptx`/`.pdf` source or an unlocked export, then rerun story 2.0.

## [2026-02-13 14:39:35 -0500] - 3.0: Extract and fully clean Project Blue Jay - Simulated Report 2025.pdf

  - extracted/verification/project-blue-jay-simulated-report-2025/qa/gates.json
- What was implemented:
  - Ran isolated single-report extraction for `reports/Project Blue Jay - Simulated Report 2025.pdf` and generated full verification artifacts.
  - Generated strict source-text artifacts at `extracted/verification/project-blue-jay-simulated-report-2025/source-text`.
  - Completed full-report canonical cleanup and added required metadata + source-to-extraction coverage map.
  - Completed review checklist, ran provenance + fail-closed gates, and marked review status `pass`.
  - Updated story 3.0 state to `passes=true`, `blocked=false`, `blockedReason=""`.
- **Learnings:**
  - Some PDFs are image-only in strict extraction; when source-text artifacts are empty across pages, preserve canonical sections as `Not present in source report` and document the zero-text condition explicitly.

- What was implemented:
  - Ran isolated strict extraction for `reports/Project Cherry - Simulated Report 2025.pdf` and generated full verification artifacts.
  - Generated strict source-text artifacts at `extracted/verification/project-cherry-simulated-report-2025/source-text` using `scripts/extract_source_text.py`.
  - Performed full-report cleanup across canonical sections, removed engagement/legal/cover/navigation fragments, and aligned markdown to template metadata + source-to-extraction coverage map.
  - Completed review-notes checklist, ran provenance + fail-closed gates, and marked review status `pass`.
  - Updated PRD story metadata to `passes=true`, `blocked=false`, `blockedReason=""`.
- **Learnings:**
  - Strict provenance for this PDF required selecting only lines with exact matches in `source-text` artifacts; visually similar extractor lines still fail fail-closed exact matching.

## [2026-02-13 14:53:00 EST] - 5.0: Extract and fully clean Project Cinema Report.pdf

  - extracted/manifests/project-cinema-report.json
  - extracted/verification/project-cinema-report/*
- What was implemented:
  - Ran isolated strict extraction for `reports/Project Cinema Report.pdf` and regenerated strict source-text artifacts.
  - Performed full-report cleanup and rebuilt selected-lines/render-trace/section mapping artifacts from exact source-backed lines, then aligned markdown to canonical template metadata and completed source-to-extraction coverage map.
  - Completed review-notes checklist and reran provenance + fail-closed gates to pass.
  - Updated PRD story state for 5.0 to `passes=true`, `blocked=false`, `blockedReason=""`.
- **Learnings:**
  - Provenance exact-match can pass while `cleanup_quality` still fails; fragment cleanup must be run before final gate execution.
  - Updating render, trace, selected-lines, and section mapping artifacts together prevents markdown/trace sync regressions during manual cleanup.
