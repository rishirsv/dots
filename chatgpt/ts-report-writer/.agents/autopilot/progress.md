# Progress Log

- Initialized batch PRD for remaining reports.
- Generated 54 remaining-report stories (all source reports except completed `project-ascend-report` and `project-autobahn-report`).
- Added duplicate-stem handling policy in queue (prefer `.pptx` over `.pdf` for duplicate stems).

- Excluded benchmarking packs from queue (removed 4 stories).
- Excluded completed reports from queue (removed 0 stories).\n- Excluded case-study reports from queue (removed 1 stories).\n## [2026-02-13 14:31:32 EST] - 1.0: Extract and fully clean Example report_Private Equity lender_Project Garrison.pptx

- What was implemented:
  - Ran strict extraction for only `reports/Example report_Private Equity lender_Project Garrison.pptx` and generated report/verification artifacts.
  - Generated source-text artifacts with `scripts/extract_source_text.py` in strict mode.
  - Completed full canonical cleanup output, populated metadata + source-evidence fields, and filled source-to-extraction coverage map.
  - Completed review notes checklist and marked report review `pass` after QA.
  - Updated story state in PRD to `passes=true` and added reusable cleanup-learning guardrail.
- **Learnings:**
  - PPTX auto-mapping can leak legal/navigation content into canonical sections if cleanup is not done report-wide.
  - Enforcing a full-report cleanup pass before provenance/gates prevents executive-summary boilerplate regressions.
