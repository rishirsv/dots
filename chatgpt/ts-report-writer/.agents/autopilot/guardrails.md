# Guardrails

Signs are patterns learned from past failures. Read before each iteration.

## How to Add a Sign

When you encounter a recurring failure:
1. Add a new Sign section below
2. Document the trigger, instruction, and when it was learned
3. Log the failure in errors.log

<!-- Signs will be added below by the agent -->

### Sign: Full-Report Cleanup Required for PPTX

- **Trigger**: Extracted markdown from PPTX includes engagement-letter/legal/cover/navigation fragments in canonical sections.
- **Instruction**: Perform one full-report cleanup pass across every canonical section before QA; do not run pass/fail gating after partial section-only cleanup.
- **Added after**: Iteration 1 - Garrison extraction produced heavy boilerplate leakage from auto-mapping.
