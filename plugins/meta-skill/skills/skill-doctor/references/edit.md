# Diagnose/Edit Candidate And Source Updates

Read this as part of the Diagnose/Edit workflow when translating skill evidence
into the smallest useful improvement.

Workbench paths below are shorthand for the target project root's
`<project>/.<skill-name>/` dir (e.g. `review.md` = that dir's `review.md`). The
project root already names the skill and contains the portable skill payload at
`<project>/skill/`, so do not add another skill-name namespace. Review *lenses*
live in [rubric.md](rubric.md#review-lanes); the scoring rubric is
[rubric.md](rubric.md).

## Route Selection

| User asks for | Default route |
|---|---|
| "improve this skill", "review this skill", "diagnose this fail state", "what would you change", "is this good" | Clarify and Diagnose/Edit |
| "update", "patch", "fix", "apply your changes", "make the edit" | Apply a surgical edit |
| "run evals", "use this trace", "use a subagent", "iterate", "autonomously improve" | Evidence loop |
| "test one prompt", "try the candidate in another thread", "use a worktree", "trial this improvement" | Skill trial run |
| Ambiguous improvement request | Clarify and Diagnose/Edit |

Clarify and Diagnose/Edit is the default. **Do not silently rewrite the target
skill payload, generated plugin packages, docs, or source files just because the
user gave feedback or asked what should change.** Human feedback is *evidence*;
it is not edit authorization unless the user asks to **make, apply, update,
patch, or fix** now.

Writing `review.md` (and `spec.md`) is allowed and expected during
diagnosis/review — they are review artifacts, not payload edits.

## First Read

Before diagnosing or changing anything in the Diagnose/Edit workflow, identify:

- skill name and folder
- current description and trigger contract
- core job
- linked references, scripts, assets, and metadata
- `review.md` and other `.<skill-name>/` evidence available
- the user's requested scope
- whether the user authorized edits or only requested diagnosis

Do not let a broad improvement request become an unbounded rewrite.

## Evidence Sources

Valid improvement evidence:

- file/link review failures or warnings
- a completed `review.md` with a concrete finding heading
- explicitly captured deterministic test or validation output
- a subagent's review findings (as evidence support)
- saved artifacts tied to a user-observed failure
- a concrete user-observed failure

Generated review worksheets that still contain *Agent review required*
placeholders are **not** edit evidence — complete the review first, or cite a
different concrete source. If evidence is missing, ask the user to provide
concrete feedback, run available deterministic tests, inspect saved failure
evidence, or authorize a manual review path.

For read-only review requests, complete `review.md` as a Quality page using
[rubric.md](rubric.md) when artifact writes are allowed. Treat broad "do not
edit files" instructions as forbidding *payload, package, docs, and source*
edits, not the review-artifact write — unless the user explicitly forbids
artifact writes too. If zero writes are required, say the full review artifact
cannot be produced under that constraint, then do a manual read-only review or
ask permission to write `review.md`. The completed report is the evidence
artifact; for later edit requests, cite `review.md` and the finding heading
before changing the portable payload.

For subagent review, the subagent is evidence support only. The parent owns
diagnosis, candidate edits, final editing, validation, and the recommendation.

## Skill Trial Run

For one-off prompt-doctor improvements, read
[skill-trial-runs.md](../../../references/skill-trial-runs.md). Use a Codex
worktree child thread when the candidate edit should be tested without mutating
the parent checkout. The child may apply or inspect the candidate in its
worktree and return the structured trial result; the parent decides whether to
apply the source edit, refresh review/verify evidence, or escalate to
`skill-evaluator`.

This route is not a full evaluation suite. Use it for one realistic prompt or
review pass that would make the edit decision clearer.

## Prompt Doctor Loop

1. Name the observed fail state in plain language.
2. Classify: activation, runtime clarity, output contract, resource, runtime
   contamination, evidence, cross-skill boundary, approval/control, or
   validation gap.
3. Separate a recurring failure pattern from a one-off edge eval.
4. Find the smallest likely source: description, boundary, example, workflow
   branch, output contract, reference pointer, script contract, or missing gate.
5. Produce two or three candidate edits that fix the behavior while preserving
   the approved trigger and runtime surface.
6. Scan each candidate diff for source provenance, stale references, and
   negative-only rules. Prefer replacing misleading or over-emphasized guidance
   with the positive behavior the skill should perform. Do not add negative
   rules that reference removed, absent, or de-emphasized concepts unless that
   concept is the concrete recurring failure; when a negative guard is needed,
   pair it with the desired behavior.
7. Recommend one — the smallest strong fix — and say why.
8. If the user authorized direct edits, apply it. Otherwise stop with a standard
   clarify-style approval question.
9. Add a broad rule only when the agent would likely repeat the mistake without it.
10. Record changed behavior, evidence, rejected tempting edits, and residual risk
   in `spec.md` when durable notes are needed.

Prefer replacing a misleading sentence over adding a prohibition. Preserve
unrelated behavior.

## Diagnosis Shape

```md
## Current Understanding
<what the user wants improved and what must be preserved>

## Diagnosis
Observed fail state: <specific bad behavior>
Likely source: <description, workflow branch, output contract, reference, script, or missing gate>
Evidence: <file path, run ID, eval ID, trace, user feedback, or exact section>

## Candidate Edits
1. <edit option and tradeoff>
2. <edit option and tradeoff>
3. <optional edit option and tradeoff>

Recommended edit: <one option>
Validation to run: <file review, test, or review refresh>
```

Avoid vague diagnoses like "make it clearer." Name the phrase, section, workflow
branch, or evidence row causing the risk.

## Surgical Update Rules

- Edit the skill's **source-of-truth**, never a generated copy a build would
  overwrite. In *this* repo: source under `plugins/dots/skills/<name>/` or
  `plugins/meta-skill/skills/<name>/`; never hand-edit generated packages under
  `dist/**`. Other projects: find the equivalent source-vs-build split first.
- Preserve name and folder unless rename is in scope.
- Preserve the user-approved trigger meaning.
- Preserve output contract, tone, and runtime surface unless they are the problem.
- For direct edit requests, still state the diagnosis briefly before patching.
- Keep unrelated resources unchanged.
- Prefer smaller changes when two edits protect behavior equally well.
- Reject edits that restate existing guidance or trade one ambiguity for another.
- A `description` change alters triggering/routing — surface it explicitly.
