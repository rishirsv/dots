# Judge Prompt Guidance

Read this when creating or revising `.meta-skill/evals/judges/*.md`.

Judges are human-authored rubrics or pass/fail prompts for subjective qualities. They are optional by default because they cost tokens and should never replace deterministic tests when code can answer the question.

## File Shape

Use Markdown with minimal frontmatter:

```md
---
id: final-answer-quality
type: rubric
scale: 1-5
inputs: [task, final]
---

# Final Answer Quality Judge

You evaluate the final answer for the user's task.

## Rubric

5: Excellent. Complete, specific, well-structured, directly usable.
4: Good. Minor gaps, still usable.
3: Adequate. Meets the core request with noticeable omissions.
2: Weak. Partially useful but misses important requirements.
1: Poor. Fails the task or misleads the user.

## Output

Return JSON with an overall score and critique.

## Calibration Examples

- A complete final answer with traceable source claims scores 5.
- A final answer with unsupported material claims scores at most 3.
```

Supported judge types:

- `rubric`: universal 1-5 score plus critique
- `pass_fail`: binary subjective judgment for one specific failure mode

## Thresholds

Thresholds live in `case.md` criteria frontmatter, not in judge files:

```json
{
  "id": "final-answer-quality",
  "threshold": {
    "overall_min": 4
  }
}
```

The same judge can be report-only in one case and thresholded in another.

## Good Judge Scope

Use one judge for one recurring subjective pattern. Good scopes include source faithfulness, recommendation quality, final-answer usefulness, tone fit, and ambiguity handling.

Avoid broad "overall quality" judges as the main signal. If a deterministic test can answer the question, write a test instead.

## Inputs

Feed only the information needed:

- task text
- final response
- selected final-output excerpts
- relevant source excerpts
- deterministic test summaries

Do not feed private evaluator answer keys into solver workspaces. Judges run over saved evidence after the case run.

## Anti-Patterns

- Using judges as release gates without human review.
- Hiding deterministic failures behind a good judge score.
- Setting thresholds inside judge frontmatter.
- Running judges by default without user approval.
- Asking the judge to infer missing context from vague instructions.
