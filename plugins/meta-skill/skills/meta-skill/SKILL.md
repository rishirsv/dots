Use when Meta Skill is at-mentioned, when the user asks what Meta Skill can do or how to use the CLI, or when a request may involve creating, evaluating, reviewing, improving, packaging, or releasing reusable skills; not for performing a focused lane without loading the selected lane skill."

# Meta Skill

Route broad Meta Skill requests to the right focused lane. Treat a Meta Skill mention as strong intent to use this plugin for reusable skill work. Keep this skill as the router and top-level CLI guide; do not perform focused skill creation, eval design, or evidence-backed improvement logic here.

Meta Skill helps authors create portable skill payloads, add maintained `.meta-skill/` workbenches when needed, run scenario evidence through the shared CLI, inspect results honestly, and make bounded evidence-backed improvements.

## Router Only

When a request matches `create-skill`, `evaluate-skill`, or `improve-skill`, load the focused skill before drafting, running commands, editing payload files, or interpreting evidence. If a request spans lanes, name the sequence once, then follow each selected lane in order.

Use the smallest useful lane set:

- Start with `create-skill` for new reusable skills, existing draft redesigns, source-pack distillation, workflow capture, trigger-contract decisions, runtime payload structure, and portable-vs-project-mode choices.
- Use `evaluate-skill` for `.meta-skill/evals/` setup, manual eval authoring, App Server-backed `meta-skill run` execution, run inspection, baseline runs, and eval evidence interpretation.
- Use `improve-skill` for best-practice review, lint-backed findings, eval-backed edits, trace-backed fixes, human-feedback-backed patches, and bounded redesign of existing skills.
- Handle package, release, install, publish, marketplace, or promotion questions at the Meta Skill level until a focused lane is needed for validation or edits. Require explicit user approval before any such action.

## Route Order

1. Classify the user intent: create, eval, improve, package/release, or broad help.
2. If the user asks for broad help, answer from this skill without reading every focused skill.
3. If the request names a focused lane or maps clearly to one, load that skill and follow its runtime contract.
4. If the request spans lanes, sequence them in the useful authoring order:

```text
create portable skill -> project init when needed -> lint -> author evals -> run -> inspect evidence -> improve -> lint/run again -> package only after approval
```

5. Before finalizing, report the chosen lane, files changed or evidence created, validation run, and any human gate still outstanding.

## Broad Help

For requests such as `what can you do?`, `how do I use Meta Skill?`, `help`, `orient me`, or CLI capability questions, answer from the map below instead of routing into a focused lane unless the user asks to start work.

Use this shape:

```md
Meta Skill can help with:
- Creating portable reusable skills from a workflow, draft, source pack, or example output
- Adding a `.meta-skill/` workbench for evals, runs, tests, and maintained-skill evidence
- Running App Server-backed skill evals and inspecting saved evidence
- Reviewing or patching skills from lint, eval, trace, or human-feedback evidence
- Packaging a validated payload after explicit approval

Good first prompts:
- `@Meta Skill create a reusable skill for this workflow.`
- `@Meta Skill add evals for this skill.`
- `@Meta Skill improve this skill from run <run-id>.`
```

Keep the answer user-facing. Avoid exposing implementation details unless the user asks how the CLI or plugin internals work.

## CLI Guidance

Use the `meta-skill` CLI for stable file actions the user has authorized. Prefer the source project path over installed runtime copies.

Common commands:

```bash
meta-skill create <skill-dir> --slug <slug> --title "<title>" --description "<Use when ...; not for ...>" --job "<job>"
meta-skill create <skill-dir> --project --slug <slug> --title "<title>" --description "<Use when ...; not for ...>" --job "<job>"
meta-skill project init <skill-dir>
meta-skill evals create <project>
meta-skill lint <project-or-skill>
meta-skill run <project> [--eval <id>] [--type <R|F|G>] [--topic <topic>] [--label "..."] [--no-skill]
meta-skill package <project> [--out <zip>] [--out-dir <dir>]
```

Command routing:

- `create` writes a portable skill payload. Add `--project` only when the user needs evals, tests, comparison, release discipline, or maintained-skill evidence.
- `project init` adds `.meta-skill/` to an existing portable payload without moving the runtime files.
- `evals create` reads `.meta-skill/eval-scenarios.md` and creates draft `.meta-skill/evals/<ID-slug>/eval.md` files.
- `lint` validates the portable payload, workbench shape, links, evals, and deterministic tests. Use it after create, after edits, before runs, and before packaging.
- `run` records new eval evidence under `.meta-skill/runs/<run-id>/`. Working-payload runs force-attach the selected skill, so treat the result as mounted-skill behavior evidence, not true trigger-routing proof.
- `package` runs lint and exports the current portable payload. Use it only after explicit user approval for packaging, and keep install, publish, marketplace sync, or promotion as separate explicit approvals.

## Skill Map

### create-skill

Route here for turning a workflow, example output, existing skill draft, or repeated knowledge-work task into a reusable portable skill. It owns trigger boundaries, skill-or-not decisions, runtime payload design, source-pack distillation, conversation-to-skill capture, project-mode decisions, and creation-time lint.

Do not use it for running evals, improving from evidence, packaging, installing, or publishing.

### evaluate-skill

Route here for setting up, running, auditing, or interpreting App Server-backed evals with `meta-skill run`. It owns `.meta-skill/eval-scenarios.md`, `.meta-skill/evals/`, `.meta-skill/runs/`, eval types `R`, `F`, and `G`, baseline runs with `--no-skill`, and evidence readouts.

Do not use it for rewriting skills, best-practice review, packaging, installing, or publishing.

### improve-skill

Route here for reviewing or patching an existing skill from evidence: lint output, eval run ID, eval ID, test failure, trace, saved evidence file, or human feedback. It owns review-only findings, surgical edits, bounded redesigns, and rerunning relevant validation after edits.

Do not use it for creating new skills, running evals, autonomous rewrites without evidence, packaging, installing, or publishing.

## Top-Level Gates

Ask for explicit approval before packaging, installing, publishing, syncing to a marketplace, promoting a candidate into source, writing to external systems, or final-delivering a user-facing artifact.

Completed lint or eval execution is useful evidence, not proof that a skill is good. When reporting results, name what ran, what files exist, what the evidence shows, and what remains unverified.
