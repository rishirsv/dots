# CLI Conventions

Read this for shared `meta-skill` command behavior across create, eval, and improve lanes.

## Command Surface

Meta Skill uses one TypeScript CLI with top-level commands:

```bash
meta-skill create ...
meta-skill create --project ...
meta-skill project init <skill-dir>
meta-skill lint <project-or-skill> [--json]
meta-skill run <project> [--case <id>] [--type <R|F|G>] [--topic <topic>] [--label "..."] [--turn-timeout-ms <ms>] [--trace-buffer-events <count>] [--no-skill] [--no-lint]
meta-skill package <project> [--out <zip>] [--out-dir <dir>]
```

Use the supported surface above for command examples and workflow guidance.

## Path Model

The project root is also the current portable payload. It contains `SKILL.md` plus optional `agents/`, `references/`, `scripts/`, and `assets/`.

Workbench state lives under `.meta-skill/`. Commands must not create alternate root-level workbench folders.

Installed skill copies are runtime state, not canonical source. Prefer the source project path.

## Output And Exit Codes

- `0`: success, including success with advisory warnings.
- `1`: invalid project state, failed deterministic check, or unavailable runner.
- `2`: usage error, unknown command, or bad flags.

Human-readable results print to stdout. Errors print to stderr. Use `--json` only where the command supports machine-readable output.

## Human Gates

Commands may prepare evidence and packages, but the human gate remains explicit. Evidence-backed source edits are allowed when the user asks for edit mode. Require user approval before packaging, installing, publishing, syncing, external writes, or promoting a candidate as accepted.

## Evidence Rules

Run IDs are readable sequenced folders such as `001-working-payload`. Treat them as opaque once created.

Every eval run records unavailable token metrics explicitly in `trajectory.json` when exact usage cannot be collected. Do not hide missing usage fields.

Case authoring is manual. Current eval guidance uses manually authored cases, one execution source per run, read-only App Server evidence, and direct TypeScript runtime validation.
