# Distillation

Use this when the user provides a source pack — input files, process notes, and past completed outputs — and asks to make the workflow reusable. The goal is to extract the procedural method, not to embed the engagement.

## Scope

This reference owns source classification, input-to-output pairing, mechanism extraction, anti-overfit gates, rule surface form, and source provenance.

Use [design.md](design.md) for skill-or-not, trigger contract, body shape, and general intake. Use [structure.md](structure.md) for what goes in the portable runtime.

## Contents

- Distillation flow (5 steps).

## Distillation Flow

1. **Classify source roles.** Label each pack item: raw inputs, finished outputs, templates, process notes, rubrics or checklists, rejected or noisy examples, or sensitive one-off material. Items without a clear procedural role stay in project docs, not the runtime.
2. **Pair inputs to outputs.** For each reusable output section, identify which input files, fields, tabs, excerpts, or calculations informed it. A rule cannot earn its place without ≥2 input-output pairs supporting it (see Rule Gates).
3. **Classify and extract transformations.** Before writing each rule, name its transformation type: normalization, structural reshape, categorization, calculation, judgment move, caveat pattern, or check. Then state the rule in procedural form (see How to Phrase Rules). Categorical labeling forces abstraction before drafting.
4. **Validate against the rule gates.** Each candidate rule must pass all five gates. Single-engagement evidence triggers a "needs human review" flag in the spec.
5. **Map and finalize.** Decide which `SKILL.md` section each surviving rule belongs to. Attach a `source_ref` to each rule in the project spec, never in the runtime. Source pack, raw pairings, rejected candidates, and engagement-specific evidence stay in project docs.

## Rule Gates

A candidate rule must pass all five before landing in the runtime skill:

1. **Procedural Specificity.** Names a concrete mechanism — a sequence, a calculation, a judgment move, a check. Not vague advice like "be careful with adjustments."
2. **Implementable in Next Engagement.** Could be applied to a new engagement without modification. If the rule depends on engagement-specific facts, it fails.
3. **Distinct Trigger.** Has a clear "when to apply" condition. A general principle without a trigger is not a rule.
4. **Cross-Example Support.** Supported by ≥2 input-output pairs in the source pack. Single-pair evidence does not pass; flag for human review and record the rule in the spec instead of shipping it.
5. **Stable Phrasing.** Does not depend on volatile specifics (FY numbers, vendor names, deal sponsor, target client) that will rot by the next engagement.

One gate failure rejects the rule. One human-review flag records the rule in the spec but keeps it out of the runtime until reviewed.

## How Engagement Details Leak In

These are the patterns engagement-specific content takes when it slips into a runtime rule. Scan every draft for them:

- **Claim rot.** Rule cites volatile numbers, fiscal-year-specific values, or vendor names that will not survive the next engagement. Example: "EBITDA was $4.2M" should become "subtract one-time grants when normalizing EBITDA."
- **One-source overfit.** Rule's only support is the single past engagement being studied. Flag for human review; do not ship as a general rule.
- **Encyclopedia bloat.** Rule restates general knowledge the base model already has. Example: "Use the indirect method for cash flow statements" — the model knows this; the value-add is what is specific about how this team applies it.
- **Self-citation.** Rule cites the past output as authority for itself. The past output is evidence the rule was applied once; it is not authority for the rule's validity.
- **Source-tool leakage.** Rule carries through another product, repo, command, plugin, skill, or internal namespace from the source material even though the generated skill should not directly use that dependency. Replace the named surface with the user-facing concept it represents. A provider-specific session-report command should become "generate a local session-insights report" unless the runtime actually calls that command.

## How to Phrase Rules

Procedural rules survive across engagements. Instance-specific rules rot on first reuse. Language style enforces the shape:

- **Imperative verbs.** "Start by," "Prefer," "Extract," "Track," "Verify." Not "We noticed that…" or "In the Acme engagement, we…"
- **Abstract role nouns.** "Operand," "period," "entity," "measure," "target metric." Not "Q4 revenue," "the FY24 EBITDA bridge," or "Acme's NWC."
- **Placeholder templates instead of literal values.** `BASE_PERIOD = <fiscal year of the deal>` instead of `BASE_PERIOD = "FY24"`.
- **Discipline-style section headers.** "Normalization Discipline," "Tie-Out Discipline." Not "Steps for the Acme QoE."

Concrete tokens that should never appear in a runtime rule extracted from source material unless they are direct runtime dependencies: client names, deal sponsor names, dollar amounts, fiscal-year labels, file paths, identifying dates, target identifiers, repo names, product names, plugin names, skill names, command names, and provider-specific namespaces.

## Examples in the Runtime Skill

Few-shot examples are valid runtime material when they illustrate a rule without replacing it. Use them sparingly — one or two well-chosen examples per skill, anchored to specific rules.

Constraints for source-derived examples that ship in the runtime:

- **Anonymize.** Replace real client names with stand-ins ("a sponsor-owned target," "the buyer"). No real deal figures, real fiscal years, or real identifying details.
- **Label as examples.** The reader must be able to tell at a glance that the concrete content is illustrative, not instructional. Use "Example:" prefixes or dedicated example blocks.
- **Pair with the abstract rule.** An example without its rule encourages pattern-matching to the example rather than the principle. The rule comes first; the example anchors it.

If an example would require real client data or unanonymizable specifics to make sense, it belongs in project docs, not the runtime.

## What Is Not a Source

These pack contents do not yield mechanism-bearing rules. Keep them in project docs; do not feed them into runtime extraction:

- Engagement-letter boilerplate.
- Pure deliverable text without process rationale — the final report with no working papers.
- Generic training material the base model already has.
- Anonymized but otherwise template-shaped material with no unique workflow content.

## Source Provenance

Every rule extracted from a source pack must carry a `source_ref` in the project spec recording its origin. The reference lives in the spec only, never in the runtime `SKILL.md`.

Format:

```
- Rule: <the procedural rule, as it will appear in SKILL.md>
  source_ref: <path/in/pack#section-or-tab>
  transformation_type: <normalization | structural reshape | categorization | calculation | judgment move | caveat pattern | check>
  supporting_pairs: <number of input-output pairs that support this rule>
```

A maintainer can confirm each rule came from a real source-pack location and was supported by the recorded number of pairs. Rules without a `source_ref` do not ship to the runtime.

## Worked Example

Source pack excerpt (process note):

> "In the Acme QoE we normalized EBITDA by removing the $1.2M PPP forgiveness booked in Q2 2023 and adding back the $450K of management fees paid to the sponsor. We then ran a sensitivity assuming the sponsor fees would continue at 50%."

Draft rule (rejected — claim rot, self-citation, no abstract roles):

> "Remove the $1.2M PPP forgiveness and add back $450K of management fees, then sensitize sponsor fees at 50%."

Final rule (procedural, gated, with provenance in spec):

> **Normalization Discipline.** When normalizing EBITDA on a sponsor-owned target, identify (a) one-time pandemic-era subsidies booked above the line, and (b) related-party fees paid to the sponsor. Remove the subsidies as one-time. Add back related-party fees if they will not continue post-close. Sensitize related-party fees at the rate the buyer expects to retain them.

Provenance recorded in the project spec, not in the runtime:

```
- Rule: Normalization Discipline (above)
  source_ref: pack/qoe-process-notes.md#ebitda-normalization
  transformation_type: normalization
  supporting_pairs: 2
```

The final rule names the *types* of items (subsidies, related-party fees), not the dollar amounts. It names the *judgment move* (sensitize at retention rate), not the specific 50%. The procedural shape survives the next engagement.
