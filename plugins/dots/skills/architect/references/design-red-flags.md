# Design red flags

Check every candidate before choosing a design. If you find one of these
problems, revise or reject the design.

## Shallow module

A shallow module exposes a large interface while hiding little complexity.
Compare the behavior and policy that the implementation handles with what
callers must learn to use the public interface. Prefer a simple interface backed
by substantial behavior.

Do not confuse a deep module with a deep call chain. A deep call chain scatters
understanding across layers. A deep module concentrates capability behind one
interface.

Look for these signs:

- Callers coordinate several methods to complete one operation.
- Public options expose internal stages or implementation choices.
- Learning the interface does not save the caller from learning the
  implementation.

## Information leakage

Information leakage makes multiple modules depend on the same internal
decision. A representation, policy, or protocol detail appears in more than
one place, so changing it requires coordinated edits.

Public re-exports of transport or wire types are leakage. Parse external data
into domain types behind the interface. Keep storage schemas, framework
objects, and protocol details private.

## Temporal decomposition

Temporal decomposition organizes modules by execution order instead of the
knowledge they own. Separate load, validate, transform, and save stages often
repeat one representation and its invariants across several boundaries.

Group code around domain knowledge and ownership. Methods that run at different
times can still belong to one module when they protect the same decisions.

## Pass-through method

A pass-through method forwards the same arguments to another method with the
same shape. It adds a layer without hiding complexity.

Remove it or move responsibility to the module that can complete the operation.
Keep a forwarding boundary only when it adds policy, adaptation, or a distinct
abstraction.
