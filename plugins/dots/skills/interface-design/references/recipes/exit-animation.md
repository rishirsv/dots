# Exit animations

Use this selected web treatment within the established motion system. Keep
required content and actions usable, and provide an immediate reduced-motion
branch. Use the project’s existing Motion package and components for the examples.

Exits are softer and less attention-grabbing than enters. The user's focus is moving to the next thing, so do not fight for it.

### Subtle exit (recommended)

```tsx
// Small fixed translateY: indicates direction without drama
<motion.div
  exit={{
    opacity: 0,
    y: -12,
    filter: "blur(4px)",
    transition: { duration: 0.15, ease: "easeOut" },
  }}
>
  {content}
</motion.div>
```

### Full exit (when context matters)

```tsx
// Slide fully out: use when spatial context is important
// (e.g., a card returning to a list, a drawer closing)
<motion.div
  exit={{
    opacity: 0,
    x: "-100%",
    transition: { duration: 0.2, ease: "easeOut" },
  }}
>
  {content}
</motion.div>
```

### Good vs. bad

```css
/* Good: subtle exit */
.item-exit {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(-12px);
  transition: opacity 150ms ease-out, transform 150ms ease-out;
}

/* Bad: dramatic exit that steals focus */
.item-exit {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(-100%) scale(0.5);
  transition: all 400ms ease-out;
}

/* Sometimes correct: remove immediately when motion adds no context */
.item-exit {
  display: none;
}
```
