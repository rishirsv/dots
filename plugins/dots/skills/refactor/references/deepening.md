# Deepening

Read this when assessing whether shallow modules should be combined, hidden behind a deeper interface, or tested through a different seam.

## Dependency Categories

Classify dependencies before recommending a deepened module. The category determines how the deepened module is tested across its seam.

### 1. In-Process

Pure computation, in-memory state, no I/O. Always deepenable: merge the modules and test through the new interface directly. No adapter needed.

### 2. Local-Substitutable

Dependencies that have local test stand-ins such as an in-memory filesystem or local database substitute. Deepenable if the stand-in exists. The deepened module is tested with the stand-in running in the test suite. The seam is internal; no port at the module's external interface.

### 3. Remote But Owned

Owned services across a network boundary. Define a port at the seam. The deep module owns the logic; the transport is injected as an adapter. Tests use an in-memory adapter. Production uses an HTTP, RPC, queue, or equivalent adapter.

Recommendation shape:

> Define a port at the seam, implement a production adapter and an in-memory adapter for testing, so the logic sits in one deep module even though it is deployed across a network.

### 4. True External

Third-party services the codebase does not control. The deepened module takes the external dependency as an injected port; tests provide a mock adapter.

## Seam Discipline

- **One adapter means a hypothetical seam. Two adapters means a real one.** Do not introduce a port unless at least two adapters are justified, typically production plus test. A single-adapter seam is just indirection.
- **Internal seams vs external seams.** A deep module can have internal seams private to its implementation and used by its own tests, as well as the external seam at its interface. Do not expose internal seams through the interface just because tests use them.

## Testing Strategy: Replace, Don't Layer

- Old unit tests on shallow modules become waste once tests at the deepened module's interface exist. Delete them.
- Write new tests at the deepened module's interface. The interface is the test surface.
- Tests assert on observable outcomes through the interface, not internal state.
- Tests should survive internal refactors. They describe behaviour, not implementation. If a test has to change when the implementation changes, it is testing past the interface.
