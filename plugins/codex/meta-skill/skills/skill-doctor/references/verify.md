# Verify

After approved edits are applied, confirm the targeted problem is resolved
without regressing the skill, then refresh the score. The doctor confirms *one*
case; `skill-evaluator` measures many.

## Run the deterministic tests

```
python3 scripts/run.py <path-to-SKILL.md>
```

This runs every deterministic task in `scripts/` (currently the structural
checks in `validate_skill.py`) and prints a combined **Verify-tests %** — one of
the three thirds of the Overall Quality Score. Re-running it here refreshes that
third after an edit; the same runner fills it during a Judge Review (see
[rubric.md](rubric.md)).

## Confirm the fix

- **After Diagnose:** re-run the reproduced failing case; confirm it no longer occurs.
- **After a Judge Review:** re-check that each addressed gap is now closed.

## Regression scan (quick, static)

- Verify-tests pass-rate did not drop.
- `description` not silently over-broadened (triggering unchanged unless that
  was the intended fix).
- References still resolve; no dead links.
- SKILL.md still skinny; no new drift with sibling skills or docs.

## Escalate

- Anything needing systematic, multi-scenario confidence → `skill-evaluator`.

## TODO

- Add deterministic tasks to `scripts/` as failure patterns recur (any `*.py`
  that prints `{passed, total}` with `--json` is picked up by `run.py`).
