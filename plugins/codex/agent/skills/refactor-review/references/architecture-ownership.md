# Architecture Ownership

Read this when a refactor candidate involves where code should live, which layer owns a rule, or how to remove duplicate policy paths.

Focus on long-term canonical ownership, not only the layer where the current bug appears.

## Required Discovery

Before deciding ownership:

- Read the repo docs that define architecture, boundaries, or responsibilities.
- Read ADRs or design docs that define runtime flow, request flow, or package boundaries.
- Inspect the top-level project structure to map the repo's concrete module or package names onto the generic layers in this reference.

When docs are incomplete:

- infer the current layer model from the codebase
- state the assumption explicitly
- keep the recommendation aligned to one canonical owner

## Required Output

When answering an ownership or placement question, explicitly separate:

- `Runtime owner`
- `First fix owner`
- `Canonical long-term owner`
- `Competing owners that are wrong`
- `Cleanup direction`

Do not collapse these into a single answer.

## Decision Order

1. Identify the runtime concern:
   - visible UI state
   - platform shell or OS bridge
   - runtime composition or request dispatch
   - canonical domain or application workflow
   - pure shared logic
   - concrete adapter or integration behavior
2. Name the layer where the wrong behavior currently happens.
3. Decide whether that layer is only the `First fix owner` or also the `Canonical long-term owner`.
4. If the behavior is reusable product or business policy, move the long-term owner out of the runtime orchestration layer.
5. Remove duplicate policy, fallback logic, or dual paths once the canonical owner is clear.

## Layer Map

- `UI layer`
  - owns visible UI state, navigation, rendering, presentation-oriented derived state, and view composition
- `Platform shell`
  - owns native shell concerns, OS bridges, local device integrations, filesystem or permission bridges, process or session plumbing, and platform-local persistence helpers
- `Runtime orchestration layer`
  - owns runtime composition, request dispatch, background coordination, worker management, event publication, and process-level orchestration
  - this is often the `First fix owner`
  - this is not automatically the `Canonical long-term owner`
- `Domain or application layer`
  - owns canonical product workflow, business rules, reusable application services, and cross-interface behavior
- `Shared core layer`
  - owns shared types, enums, validation, normalization, capability logic, and pure logic used across runtimes
- `Adapter or integration layer`
  - owns concrete protocol, provider, vendor, transport, or API integration behavior
  - does not own cross-provider or cross-integration product policy

Translate these generic layers into the repo's actual module, package, crate, or service names before making a recommendation.

## Hard-Cut Rules

- Do not leave reusable domain policy in the runtime orchestration layer just because the wrong behavior currently happens there.
- Do not put UI state, layout state, restore state, or user-facing presentation ownership in the runtime orchestration layer.
- Do not put platform shell or native integration concerns in the domain or application layer.
- Do not put cross-provider or cross-vendor product policy in adapter or integration layers.
- Do not put pure validation, normalization, or capability logic in orchestration code when it can live in shared core or a narrow domain module.

## Common Judgments

- If the question is "who should decide this for all future interfaces?" the answer is usually the domain or application layer, a narrow domain package, or shared core, not the runtime orchestration layer.
- If the question is "where do I patch this bug first so the product stops doing the wrong thing?" the answer may still be the runtime orchestration layer.
- If the question is "who owns the wire shape or payload type?" the answer is usually the shared API or core type layer, not the runtime orchestration layer.
- If the question is "who owns vendor-specific behavior?" the answer is the relevant adapter or integration layer, but only for adapter behavior, not canonical product policy.
