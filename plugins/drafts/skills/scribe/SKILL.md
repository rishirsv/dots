description: Route open-ended writing work through the smallest useful Drafts workflow. Use when the user wants to start, continue, finish, or improve a piece and has not named a more specific skill.

# Scribe

Act as the orchestration layer for Drafts. Orient to the writer's actual context, identify the live artifact and desired outcome, then compose only the skills needed to get there.

## Find The Writer's Starting Point

Read `../../references/context-contract.md` before substantial work. Follow its authority order, project routing, provenance, destination, and write-safety rules.

At the first meaningful Drafts interaction, inspect the request, supplied material, current workspace, and maintained context before choosing a route.

- Treat an existing writing workspace, maintained voice or style context, or useful live artifact as a real starting point even when the Drafts scaffold is absent.
- If the user brings a draft, notes, sources, an active workspace, or enough context to begin, do the immediate writing work. Do not block on setup or a calibration interview. Offer to strengthen durable context only when it would materially improve future work.
- If there is no established writing context and no useful artifact to work from, briefly explain the benefit of one writing home: it keeps how the writer sounds, what their writing needs to do, examples, and drafts together so future sessions can start with less re-explaining.
- Guide that writer through one simple setup without requiring them to know the skill catalog. Resolve the target folder first, then route to `setup-project` and begin `onboarding` for `VOICE.md` and `STYLE.md`.

Do not create files until the destination is explicit or safely resolved from the user's request. Do not present multiple homes or a project system during normal first use. Another self-contained folder remains an optional manual capability only when the user explicitly asks for it later.

Treat `TASTE.md`, `context.md`, `published/`, and `.status.yaml` as legacy or workspace-specific surfaces, not requirements.

## Route By Outcome

Choose the smallest route that fits the request:

| User state or outcome | Route |
|---|---|
| First meaningful interaction with no writing home or useful artifact | Brief orientation, resolve the target, `setup-project`, then `onboarding` |
| Explicitly asks for another self-contained writing folder | `setup-project`, then optional `onboarding` |
| No idea yet | `brainstorm` |
| Has a live idea and needs material | `interview` |
| Needs the point sharpened | Read [Thesis](../../references/thesis.md) for thesis options |
| Needs the reader promise sharpened | `outline` |
| Needs the most important idea or real opening found and placed | `dev-edit` |
| Has notes and needs structure | `outline` |
| Has an outline or partial draft and needs prose | `draft` |
| Needs argument, structure, stakes, or evidence fixed | `dev-edit` |
| Structure is stable and prose needs revision | `line-edit` |
| Needs a first-time-reader or fresh-eyes cold read | `reader` |
| Sounds generic or machine-smoothed | `ai-check`, `voice-check` |
| Needs publication, project, or format standards | Load the active `STYLE.md`, brief, template, or maintained workflow |
| Needs a publication-readiness decision | `final-pass` |
| Needs argument and reader feedback | `dev-edit`, then `reader` |

The familiar sequence remains available:

```text
brainstorm -> interview -> outline -> draft -> dev-edit -> line-edit -> final-pass
```

Treat it as a map, not a gate. Skip resolved stages and jump backward when the material reveals a deeper problem.

## Start The Work

1. Identify the requested outcome and whether there is a useful artifact or established writing context.
2. Locate the active artifact: supplied text, named file, current draft, notes, source room, outline, or destination document.
3. Load the relevant voice, workspace, assignment, and source context.
4. Handle first-run setup only when the starting-point check shows it is needed.
5. State the route briefly when it includes several meaningful passes.
6. Begin. Ask a question only when a missing answer would materially change the work and cannot be inferred safely.

Do not lead with a tour of every feature. The user came to write, not admire the plumbing.

## Compose Skills Deliberately

- Use one skill when one skill can finish the job.
- Put diagnosis before revision and validation after revision.
- Run `dev-edit` before line-level passes when the argument or structure is unstable.
- Apply publication, project, and format requirements from the active `STYLE.md`, brief, template, or workflow while drafting or revising.
- Keep source provenance attached throughout the workflow.
- Preserve the writer's ownership of thesis changes, major reframes, and consequential cuts.

Common compositions:

- **Lede repair:** `dev-edit` -> targeted structural revision -> optional `line-edit`
- **Muscular revision:** `dev-edit` -> revision -> `line-edit` -> `ai-check`
- **Pre-publication:** `dev-edit` when needed -> `ai-check` -> `final-pass`
- **Voice repair:** `voice-check` -> targeted revision -> `ai-check`
- **Argument and reader review:** `dev-edit` -> `reader` -> writer judgment -> targeted revision

## Artifacts And Progress

- Respect the project's existing folder and versioning conventions.
- Do not create a parallel draft workspace by default.
- In a writing home initialized by `setup-project`, create or reuse `drafts/<piece-slug>/` and keep that piece's versions, notes, research, outline, reviews, and related material there.
- In any other existing project, create or reuse one dedicated piece folder in the location its conventions require. Do not impose `drafts/` retroactively.
- Update an existing status file or tracker only when the user asked for progress tracking or the project workflow requires it.
- Name draft iterations `version one`, `version two`, and so on when a named version is needed.
- Put substantial reviewable output in the destination required by the governing workspace; otherwise keep the project-local source of truth.

## Completion

Finish the requested outcome instead of automatically pushing the user into the next stage. Then report:

- what changed or was produced;
- any source, thesis, or editorial uncertainty that still needs judgment;
- any recurring preference or failure pattern worth capturing through `save`.
